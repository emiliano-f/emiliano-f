I'm Emiliano, a computer scientist and cloud data engineer. I'm from Argentina. In my repositories, you will find projects that I have worked on during my time at university. Depending on their complexity, you may find code that is documented or not, but I commit to documenting those that I consider important for myself and for the community.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at a data consultancy company and on my personal data projects, but primarily, I'm involved in the research for my thesis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced statistics, deep learning, data engineering tools, and Amazon Web Services.

ðŸŽ¯ My next goals after completing my thesis are to actively collaborate on open-source projects and obtain GCP and AWS certifications.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my expertise in Google Cloud platform, Python, Java, C, Rust, Bash, and SQL.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him

Feel free to reach out to me, even to discuss working on projects together.
